## 🚀 About Me

I am a final-year BSc IT student at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology, specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning. My focus is on designing structured, scalable data systems that transform raw data into reliable, analytics-ready assets.

Currently part of the **CAPACITI Data Engineering Cohort**, where I apply industry-aligned data engineering practices to real-world scenarios.

I am particularly interested in:

- **Data Engineering** – ETL pipeline development, workflow orchestration, and data warehousing
- **Data Modeling** – Star schema design, dimensional modeling, SCD Type 2 implementation
- **Machine Learning** – Regression modeling, feature engineering, applied ML systems
- **Workflow Automation** – Python scripting, Bash automation, Airflow DAG design
- **Cloud Deployment** – Deploying containerized applications on AWS and Azure
